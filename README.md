# MercadoLibreLinks Analyst 

# I'm a growth analyst at MercadoLibreLinks to an external site.. With over 200 million users, MercadoLibre is the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America. I've been tasked with analysing the company's financial and user data in clever ways to help the company grow. So, I want to find out if the ability to predict search traffic can translate into the ability to successfully trade the stock.
